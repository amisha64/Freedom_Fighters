        <p>Chandrasekhar Azad, original name Chandrasekhar Tiwari was born in July 23, 1906, Bhabra, India.Azad was drawn into the Indian national movement at a young age. When apprehended by the police at age 15 while participating in Mohandas K. Gandhi’s noncooperation movement (1920–22) at Banares.he gave his name as Azad and his address as “prison.”Known for his organizational skills, Azad played a key role in reorganizing the HRA as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association after most of the HRA’s members had been killed or imprisoned. His crimes had made him a wanted man, but Azad was able to elude the police and its informants for several years
            Determined never to be captured by police, Azad was constantly on the move. On February 27, 1931, Azad arranged to meet a revolutionary at Allahabad’s Alfred Park (now Azad Park). He was betrayed to the police, who surrounded him as soon as he entered the park. A gun battle ensued, in which two police officers were wounded, and Azad was fatally shot.</p>
