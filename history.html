                            <p>The 1919 horrifying incident of Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the reason behind the inception of the non cooperation movement.

                            <p>Launched in the Congress Session of December 1929, this movement was headed by Gandhiji. The objective of this rebellion was to completely disregard any orders of the British Government. Gandhiji had targeted January 26, 1930 to be celebrated as the Independence Day all across the country. The British unleashed brutality by firing bullets, killing and arresting protesters (including Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhiji) to quash the movement. </p>
